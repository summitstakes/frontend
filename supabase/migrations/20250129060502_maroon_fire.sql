  # Sports and Leagues Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `sports`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text, unique)
      - `icon` (text)
      - `active` (boolean)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `leagues`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) 
      - `name` (text)
      - `sport_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `active` (boolean)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for authenticated users
